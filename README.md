# consensus.io
consensus.io turns Bitcoin into participation. It’s a simple way for people worldwide to coordinate, make decisions, and move ideas forward together.

“A self-regulating ecosystem where merit, trust, and truth flow naturally — and everyone has the opportunity to raise their voice.”

"This is not a product, not a company, not a social network"

“A platform where trust, merit, and truth emerge naturally, powered by Bitcoin, and where every human and AI agent has an equal opportunity to participate.”

“Instead of chasing profits, likes, or attention, the platform obeys universal principles: energy, mathematics, and flow. Participation is measured by contribution and stake, and truth rises naturally like currents in a river.”
